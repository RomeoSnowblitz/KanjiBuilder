# Kanji Builder

Use the **Create** page to combine symbols into words. Supports multiple languages.

## Making images work when opened from a folder or zip (no server)

Browsers normally block loading images when the page is opened via **file://** (e.g. double‑clicking `create.html` or from an extracted zip). This app can work around that by **embedding the images** in a single JavaScript file so they load without any server.

**One-time setup (you or whoever prepares the release):**

1. In the project folder, run **one** of these (you only need Node **or** Python):
   - **Node:** `node build-embed-images.js`
   - **Python 3:** `python build-embed-images.py`
2. This creates `images-data.js` (it will be large). **Commit and push this file** to your repo (or include it in the zip).

After that, **anyone** who opens `create.html` or the app from an extracted zip will see all symbol images load automatically—no local server and no GitHub Pages required.

If `images-data.js` is missing (e.g. before the build was run), the app still runs but images won’t load when opened from file://; use GitHub Pages or a local server in that case.

## Running locally (other options)

- **Direct open:** Double‑click `index.html` or `create.html`. If `images-data.js` is present, images will load even from file://.
- **With a local server:** Run `npx serve` or `python -m http.server 8000` in this folder and open the URL in the browser. Then images load from the `placeholders/` folder without needing `images-data.js`.

Keep all files in the same folder and **do not rename the `placeholders` folder** or the image files inside it.

## Hosting on GitHub

To run the app from GitHub with images working:

1. **Use GitHub Pages**  
   Do not open the HTML files from the GitHub file browser (e.g. “View” on `create.html`). That won’t load images. Instead:
   - In your repo: **Settings → Pages**
   - Under “Source” choose **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: usually `main` (or `master`), folder: **/ (root)**
   - Save. After a minute, the site will be at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

2. **Commit the `placeholders` folder**  
   The Create page loads images from `placeholders/` (e.g. `placeholders/cold.png`). If that folder isn’t in the repo, images will not load. Ensure it’s committed:
   ```bash
   git add placeholders/
   git commit -m "Add placeholder images"
   git push
   ```

3. **Open the site via the Pages URL**  
   Visit `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` and use **Create** from there. Image paths are resolved from the page URL so they work on GitHub Pages.

## Files

- `index.html`, `create.html`, `dictionary.html`, `comments.html` – app pages
- `style.css`, `script.js`, `symbols.js`, `translations.js` – required; keep in the same folder
- `placeholders/` – symbol images; **do not rename**
- `images-data.js` – generated by `build-embed-images.js` or `build-embed-images.py`; include it (and the script tag in create/dictionary HTML) so images work from file:// without a server. If missing, the app still runs but images need a server or GitHub Pages.
